Version 3.0

This is an improved and updated version of xspde version 2. The most significant change is a re-ordering of array indices. In version 3,  array indices for ensembles and error-bars are the last index. This is largely invisible to the user, unless additional software is written to read and write files. 

Version 3.1

This has an improved treatment of non-periodic boundary conditions, in stochastic differential equations, including Neuman, Dirichlet, Robin and nonlinear boundaries. 

Version 3.2

This has a different treatment of noise filtering in momentum space, per user request, and adds new three-dimensional graphics output options, including color mapped contours.
