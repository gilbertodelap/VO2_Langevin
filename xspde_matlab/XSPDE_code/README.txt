xSPDE

The xSPDE folder should contain the xSIM, xGRAPH and xAMPLES folder.

Set your Matlab path to include this folder and subfolders, or just install the provided xSPDE toolbox.

Run xAMPLES/Batchtest.m to test operation.

XSPDE runs best combined with the Matlab parallel toolbox.

If you have no parallel toolbox, set ensembles(3) = 1 in the examples.

Happy xspde-ing.
