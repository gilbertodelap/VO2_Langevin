# xspde_matlab

xSPDE is an extensible Stochastic Partial Differential Equation solver. 
It is a complete stochastic toolbox for constructing simulations.
The modular design of xSPDE can be changed to suit different applications.
At a basic level just a few lines of input are enough to specify the equation.
To install xSPDE, just download the main folder, or install the toolbox.
It contains: the xSPDE folder, users guide folder, and the doc documentation folder. 
Set your Matlab path to include the  xSPDE folder and subfolders.
Run Examples/Batchtest.m to test operation.
xSPDE runs best combined with the Matlab parallel toolbox.
If you have no parallel toolbox, set ensembles(3) = 1 in the examples.
